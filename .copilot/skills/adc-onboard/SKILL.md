# ADC Project Onboarding

Use this skill to bring a project under the Autonomous Development Constitution (ADC). The goal is to create or repair the project's `.adc/` governance layer so future AI and human work starts from stable, project-local context and the project can integrate with ContextGraph/CGA consistently.

This skill applies to target application repositories. For changing ADC itself, use `adc-update`. For project activity reporting after onboarding, use `report-progress`. ContextGraph project registration, token creation, and full indexing should follow the CGA Admin UI and `cga-mcp-server` workflow described in the generated ADC files.

## Scope

In scope:

1. Confirm the target repository root in a multi-root workspace.
2. Inspect existing project facts from source, manifests, docs, and current ADC files.
3. Create or repair the required `.adc/` directory structure.
4. Populate project context, prompt rules, planning, standards, knowledge, runbooks, and ContextGraph MCP placeholders.
5. Add or update IDE trigger files and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` pointers.
6. Add `.adcignore` when needed to protect secrets, build output, caches, and generated files.
7. Validate that generated ADC context is factual, project-specific, and secret-free.
8. Ensure the `cga-mcp-server` profile and ContextGraph progress/indexing guidance are present.

Out of scope:

1. Changing ADC's canonical templates or constitution rules. Use `adc-update`.
2. Creating, printing, or storing CGA tokens. Use CGA Admin UI and environment variables after the ADC shell exists.
3. Running production deployment. Use CPMD or deployment skills.
4. Inventing architecture decisions, credentials, service URLs, or project status.

## Use When

- The user asks to onboard a project to ADC.
- A repository is missing `.adc/`, `.adc/index.md`, `.adc/prompt-rules.md`, or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- A project has scattered planning/docs and needs normalized ADC context.
- A new project needs AI-readable governance before feature work begins.
- A project has stale CCS/context docs that should be represented through ADC.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is to update ADC's own reusable rules or templates.
- The request is only CGA work briefing reporting. Use `report-progress`.
- The request is only manual CGA token creation or rotation.
- The user only wants a code change, bug fix, or deployment.
- The target path is ambiguous and cannot be resolved safely.

## Required Inputs

Required:

- Target repository path.
- Project name.
- Current project type or stack, if not discoverable from manifests.

Helpful optional inputs:

- Product purpose and audience.
- Active phase or current goal.
- Known no-touch areas.
- Existing deployment/runtime constraints.

## Canonical ADC Structure

Create or repair this structure at the project root:

```text
.adc/
+-- index.md
+-- prompt-rules.md
+-- bootstrap.md
+-- planning/
|   +-- status.md
|   +-- project-roadmap.md

+-- standards/
|   +-- conventions/
|   |   +-- structure.md
|   |   +-- frontend.md
|   |   +-- backend.md

    +-- tasks/
    |   +-- todo/
    |   +-- in-progress/
    |   +-- done/
    +-- skills/
```

Root-level support files should include the applicable trigger pointers:

- `.adcignore`
- `.cursorrules`
- `.windsurfrules`
- `.clinerules`
- `.roomadesrules`
- `.aider.rules`
- `.codexrules`
- `.antigravityrules`
- `.codeiumrules`
- `.codyrules`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

## Onboarding Procedure

### 1. Resolve Repository Root

- In multi-root workspaces, identify the exact target repository before reading or writing files.
- Confirm whether the repository already has `.adc/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md`, CCS `.context/`, or other governance files.
- Do not overwrite user-authored governance files blindly; preserve useful project-specific facts.

### 2. Gather Existing Facts

Read only enough context to write accurate ADC files:

- README and product docs.
- Package manifests such as `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `docker-compose.yml`, and Dockerfiles.
- Existing `.env.example`, config files, and deployment docs.
- Test folders and build scripts.
- Existing architecture docs, ADRs, diagrams, and known issues.

Do not read or print real `.env` values, private keys, token dumps, or secret logs.

### 3. Generate The ADC Shell

- Prefer the canonical ADC template/generator when working inside the ADC repository.
- For a target project, create only missing folders/files or carefully merge into existing ones.
- Keep `src/`, `docs/`, `tests/`, and application files as root-level siblings of `.adc/`; do not place application source under `.adc/`.
- Keep `contextgraph-edge-agent/scratchpad/` and `contextgraph-edge-agent/tasks/` as operational context only, not canonical product truth.

### 4. Populate Required Files

Minimum content requirements:

- `.adc/index.md`: YAML frontmatter with project name, version, description, tech stack, architecture style, and entry points; body with project overview, core modules, environment requirements, knowledge references, and ADC alignment notes.
- `.adc/bootstrap.md`: exact setup, install, test, and local run commands. Mark unknown commands as unknown instead of inventing them.
- `.adc/prompt-rules.md`: project-specific mandatory AI rules, workflow rules, security rules, ContextGraph use policy, and retrieval policy if applicable.
- `.adc/planning/status.md`: current phase, active goals, recent changes, and blockers.
- `.adc/planning/project-roadmap.md`: near-term and long-term milestones.
- `.adc/planning/development-phases.md`: actionable implementation phases.
- `.adc/knowledge/glossary.md`: project vocabulary and acronyms.
- `.adc/knowledge/known-issues.md`: technical debt and no-touch zones.
- `.adc/knowledge/amendments.md`: governance change log.
- `.adc/standards/conventions/*.md`: domain-specific rules only where relevant.
- `.adc/standards/checklists/pr-review.md`: pre-merge checklist.
- `.adc/standards/runbooks/001-common-errors.md`: known local/CI recovery steps.

### 5. Apply Core ADC Policies

Carry these defaults into the target project's ADC files unless project-local policy explicitly supersedes them:

- Keep source logic in `src/`, scripts in `src/scripts/` or the project's established scripts folder, tests in `tests/` or the established test root, and user-facing docs in `docs/`.
- Do not commit secrets, tokens, private keys, or real `.env` values.
- Declare new environment variables in `.env.example` with safe placeholder values.
- Prefer TDD for new features and run project-native tests before completion.
- Default web applications should use FastAPI, PostgreSQL with `pgvector`, dark mode, and the login background pattern from `.adc/standards/conventions/frontend.md` unless project constraints explicitly override them.
- Dashboard/admin surfaces should follow the density and navigation rhythm of `https://admin-demo.vuestic.dev` unless a project-local design system supersedes it.
- Before adding or changing service endpoints, document the change in project ADC files and update MCP/bootstrap wiring when ContextGraph integration is affected.
- For CPMD, source branches must merge into `main` and then be deleted remotely and locally.
- For webpage testing, default to VS Code built-in browser tooling; use external Browser Agent only for explicit exceptions.
- For frontend visualization, use `d3-tube-map` for dynamic metro-style state-machine indicators, AntV or ECharts for normal node/edge graphs, and `sigma` for 2.5D graph/network views.
- ContextGraph MCP is for retrieval, indexing, progress reporting, and external context operations; it must not replace local build, lint, unit test, or integration test execution.
- Projects should periodically report progress to CGA and run `index_repo_changes(repo_path)` through `cga-mcp-server` after meaningful source, documentation, configuration, or test changes.

### 6. Wire Tooling And Triggers

- Add or update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to point agents to `.adc/index.md` first.
- Add IDE trigger files that instruct tools to load `.adc/index.md`, `.adc/prompt-rules.md`, and relevant standards.
- Add `.adcignore` to exclude `.env`, secrets, build output, dependency folders, logs, caches, and large generated assets.
- Add or refresh `.adc/contextgraph-edge-agent/mcp/mcp-servers.json` with a `cga-mcp-server` endpoint profile. Use environment variable placeholders only; do not write token values into tracked files.
- Include ContextGraph progress reporting and indexing guidance: `CONTEXTGRAPH_BRIEFING_API_URL`, `CONTEXTGRAPH_INDEXING_POLICY=auto-incremental`, periodic reporting, and `index_repo_changes(repo_path)` after meaningful changes.

### 7. Validate

- Confirm required files exist.
- Confirm `.adc/index.md` frontmatter is valid and factual.
- Confirm `.adc/prompt-rules.md` includes mandatory core rules, ContextGraph use policy, and retrieval/token policy when applicable.
- Confirm no real secrets or credential-bearing URLs were added.
- Run project-native formatting/tests only if onboarding changed executable config or scripts.
- Record onboarding notes in `.adc/planning/status.md` or `.adc/knowledge/amendments.md` as appropriate.

## Failure Handling

- Missing project facts: write `Unknown` or ask one concise question; do not fabricate.
- Existing conflicting ADC files: preserve them and merge conservatively.
- Secret discovered in a tracked file: do not print it; report the file path and ask for rotation/remediation.
- CGA unavailable: create ADC structure and note that ContextGraph registration, indexing, or progress reporting remains blocked.
- Test/build command missing: report that validation was structural only.

## Safe Output Format

Final output should include:

- Target repository path.
- ADC files created or updated.
- Project facts used and any unknowns left unresolved.
- Validation performed.
- ContextGraph/CGA registration, MCP profile, indexing, and progress-reporting status or next step.
- Any blockers requiring human input.

## Success Criteria

ADC onboarding is complete when:

1. The target repository has the required `.adc/` structure and trigger files.
2. Required ADC files contain project-specific, factual content.
3. Secrets are excluded and `.adcignore` protects sensitive/noisy paths.
4. Local AI instructions point to `.adc/index.md` and `.adc/prompt-rules.md`.
5. The `cga-mcp-server` profile is present when applicable, with real CGA tokens kept in environment variables and initial indexing handled through ContextGraph after registration.
6. Validation confirms structure, frontmatter, and no obvious secret leakage.
